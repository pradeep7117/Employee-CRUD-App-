2. The README.md File
This Markdown file acts as your project's guide for collaborators and users.

# Employee CRUD Management System – Project title.

Description – One-line summary of the application’s functionality.

## Technologies Used – Highlights the key tools and frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Maven).

## How to Run – Step-by-step setup and run instructions using Maven. Essential for onboarding and testing.

3. The .gitignore File
This file tells Git which files and directories to exclude from version control.

Key Entries:
*.class – Ignore compiled Java class files.

*.log – Exclude runtime-generated logs.

*.jar, *.war – Ignore packaged application files.

target/ – Maven's output directory for builds (should never be committed).

.idea/, *.iml, etc. – IDE-specific config files (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), which are user-dependent.
